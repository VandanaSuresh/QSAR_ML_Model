# QSAR_ML_Model_Development

QSAR modelling using Machine Learning gives understanding about Chemical and Biological structural relationship , biological activity of drug compounds.

In this QSAR based model development for Giloblastoma using Machine Learning approaches, the detailed work flow includes;

1 ) Downloading the data from :https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/drug_data

2)  Filtering the data on the basis of log IC50 value

3)  Data preprocessing

4)  Descriptor Calculation using PADeL Software 

5)  Feature Selection using Weka Software : https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/

6)  Model Development
